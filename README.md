# Javascript tests for applicants
This is a repository **for employees** to review the current level of **knowledge, thinking and code quality** of interview subjects.

*Try to give a generic solution, rather than just satisfy the unit tests, since it doesn't do any good for anyone.:)*

## The tasks consist of implementation of several algorithms:
1. [Palindromes](https://github.com/tokdaniel/js-test/blob/master/tasks/1.%20Palindrome%20check/README.md) - Check if the given input is a palindrome.
2. [Fibonacci](https://github.com/tokdaniel/js-test/blob/master/tasks/2.%20Fibonacci%20-%20recursive/README.md) - Implement a function recursively, which returns the fibonacci numbers until N.
3. [Balanced Parentheses](https://github.com/tokdaniel/js-test/blob/master/tasks/3.%20Balanced%20parentheses/README.md) - Determine if the given input string's parentheses are balanced.
4. [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/tokdaniel/js-test/blob/master/tasks/4.%20FizzBuzz/README.md) - Give your implementation of FizzBuzz.
5. [Caesar's Cipher](https://github.com/tokdaniel/js-test/blob/master/tasks/5.%20Caesar%20cipher/README.md) - Give your implementation of Caesar's cipher
6. [Reduce](https://github.com/tokdaniel/js-test/tree/master/tasks/6.%20Implement%20reduce) - Implement the javascript utility reduce.
7. [Circle Contains](https://github.com/tokdaniel/js-test/tree/master/tasks/7.%20Is%20Point%20inside%20Circle) - Determine if a given point is inside the area of a circle.

### In every task folder there is a more detailed explanation of the expected task.
* These are in order of difficulty (according to my subjective judgement).
* I plan to extend the list with new tasks in the future

## What you'll need to solve them
* Your favourite IDE, editor or other stuff that lets you conveniently edit code.
* Cloning, or saving this repository to your local filesystem.
* Some of the newer versions of node.js (https://nodejs.org).
* Opening a command line and run ```npm install``` in the root folder.
* Diving in & some usage of google

## Check your solutions
If you think your solution is fine run the **check.bat** file it will open a **report in your default browser** and tell you if something is wrong. If you are using linux or mac, I hope you'll know what to do (execute the npm test command, and open mochawesome.html).
